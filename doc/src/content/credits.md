# Special thanks

To Paul Bristow who <a href="https://lists.boost.org/Archives/boost/2015/05/222687.php">
proposed the name "Outcome"</a> for the library after a very extended
period of name bikeshedding on boost-dev. I had been minded to call the library "Boost.Donkey"
just to shut everyone up because the name bike shedding was getting ridiculous. But
Outcome is a lot nicer, so thank you Paul.

My heartfelt thanks to Charley Bay for acting as review manager for Outcome in May 2017.
It is becoming ever harder to find a Boost review manager, so thank you! My thanks also
to the CppCast team Rob Irving and Jason Turner for so quickly getting me on to CppCast
to discuss `expected<T, E>` during the Outcome peer review to help publicise the review.

More general thanks are due to those on boost-dev, Reddit and SG14 for extensive and often very detailed
feedback on the library pretty much from its beginning. You are all too numerous to
remember, but certainly Tongari and Andrzej Krzemienski come to mind as having engaged
in particularly long discussion threads with tons of useful feedback which clarified my
thinking. Andrzej also went through the documentation with a fine toothed comb before the
review, finding many small errata and confusing wording.

Finally, my thanks to Vicente for driving Expected from its beginnings to hopefully
standardisation before 2020. It's many years of work getting something standardised, even
more years than getting a library into Boost which as you can see from the history above
took about three years.
