Herein lies the Boost-ified edition of standalone https://github.com/ned14/outcome.
This repo is generated by **script** and thus any changes made here will get eaten!

Todo:
- [x] Write script suitable for cronjob conversion of standalone Outcome
directory structure to Boost one.
- [x] Write regex based find and replace in files.
- [x] Write Jamfile for test suite.
- [ ] Rewrite config.hpp to use Boost instead of QuickCppLib.
- [ ] Convert over the docs somehow? Can't submodule hugo :(
